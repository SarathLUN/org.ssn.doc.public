Network fees
============

To prevent ledger spam and maintain the efficiency of the network, SSN requires small transaction fees and minimum balances on accounts.

# Cost per operation

SSN transactions can contain anywhere from 1 to a defined limit of 100 operations. The fee for a given transaction is equal to the number of operations the transaction contains multiplied by the base fee for a given ledger.

```
Transaction fee = # of operations * base fee
```

***The base fee for 1 (one) operation is 1 (one) native token***, regardless of the type or value of the operation. 

SSN deducts the entire fee from the transaction’s source account, regardless of which accounts are involved in each operation or who signed the transaction.

The native token (NT) has a fix exchange rate of 

```
1 native token (NT) = 100 KHR
```

In order to support micro transactions SSN has implemented a discount program via the transaction builder API provided to all users via the SSN 3rd party API. When using the API to build a transaction for a operation with USD or KHR tokens, the API will apply the following rates:

|  | KHR | USD | Fee in NT |
| --- | --: |--: |--: |
| less then |  2000 | 0.50 | 0.10 |
| less then |  4000 | 1.00 | 0.20 |
| less then | 10000 | 5.00 | 0.50 |
| less then | 40000 | 10.00 | 0.80 |
| great or equal | 40000 | 10.00 | 1.00 |

The discount only applies to operations with the asset code KHR or USD, any other asset code will be charge the standard fee.

Organizations who want to use SSN to facility non value based transactions can apply for being included in the discount program. 

***Native tokens should never be accepted by merchants as payment for service.***

# Account funding

Any account wishing to transact on SSN needs to hold a native token balance sufficient to pay for the operation. Accounts also need to hold a balance for data storage used for trustline and data fields attached to the account.

When opening a merchant account via SSN dashboard, SSN will pay for all operations needed to setup the account and seed the account with 10 native token.

When opening a payment provider account on SSN, the SSN support team will fund the account with 100 NT to allow the payment provider to setup the account.

In order execute more operations on SSN; a account needs to purchase native tokens from SSN. 

# Minimum Account Balance

All SSN accounts must maintain a minimum balance of native tokens. The minimum balance is calculated using the base reserve, which is currently set at 1 NT:

```
Minimum Balance = (2 + # of entries) * base reserve
```

The absolute minimum balance for an account is 1 NT, which is equal to (2 + 0 entries) * 0.5 base reserve. Each additional entry reserves an additional 1 NT. Entries include:

* Trustlines
* Offers
* Signers
* Data entries

Any transaction that would reduce an account’s balance to less than the minimum will be rejected with an ```INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE``` error. Likewise, NT selling liabilities that would reduce an account’s balance to less than the minimum plus NT selling liabilities will be rejected with an ```INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE``` error.

# Buying native tokens

SSN is operating trading account for native tokens. Payment providers need to accept a trustline from the native token trading account. Once the trust has been established, the trading account will open a trading pair for the payment provider to purchase native tokens using the payment providers own token.

The network address of the trading account is:

```
GBWDQ3I5DAKB3LOYKT4KOBZMBISQOJR5FAQWYYSIKXQ3ECI3C53IGAKQ
```

Any account holding a asset with a trust line to the trading account can make a offer to buy native tokens. The network exchange will automatically match the offer and make the trade.

Given the following example ```net_payout``` rates and exchange rates on SSN: 

| Provider | Net Payout Rate
| --- | --- |
| ABA Bank | 0.9975000
| WING | 0.9965000
| PiPay | 0.9900000
| PayGo | 0.9500000

FIAT rates

| From | To
| --: | --:
| 1 USD | 4100 KHR
| 1 NT | 100 KHR

The following trading pairs would be offered on SSN

For KHR based assets:

|  | from | amount | to | amount |
| ---    | --- | --: | --- | --: |
| ABA    | KHR | 1 | NT |  0.009975 |
| WING   | KHR | 1 | NT |  0.009965 |
| PiPay  | KHR | 1 | NT |  0.009900 |
| PayGo  | KHR | 1 | NT |  0.009500 |


```shell
echo "scale=7;ntkhr=100;aba=0.9975; (1 / ntkhr) * aba;" | bc
```

For USD based assets:

|  | from | amount | to | amount |
| ---    | --- | --: | --- | --: |
| ABA    | USD | 1 | NT |  40.8975 |
| WING   | USD | 1 | NT |  40.8565 |
| PiPay  | USD | 1 | NT |  40.5900 |
| PayGo  | USD | 1 | NT |  38.9500 |

```shell
echo "scale=7;ntkhr=100;usdkhr=4100;aba=0.9975; (1 * (usdkhr / ntkhr)) * aba;" | bc
```

The rates will be adjusted for KHR to USD exchange rate as needed, based on the spot price for KHR/USD published by the National Bank of Cambodia.

SSN may not offer trades to buy back native tokens, however holders of the native tokens on the network can trade the native token freely between accounts.

# Changes to Operation Fees and Minimum Balances

Ledger limits, the base reserve, and the minimum base fee can change, but should not do so more than once every year. For the most part, you can think of them as fixed values.
