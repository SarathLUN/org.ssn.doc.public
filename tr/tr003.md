SSN QR Code Technical Details Based On EMV Co Standard
===========================================

When a merchant would like to request a payment from a customer, they can create a payment request in a form of a QR code that they can send to the customer. This QR code can be generated from either the SSN Merchant dashboard or the SSN Mobile app. The customer can then scan the QR code and proceed to make a payment as requested by the merchant.

SSN QR Codes are based on EMVCo's EMV&reg; QR Code standard. With EMV QR code standard, users can use existing mobile banking or digital wallet apps that support EMV QR Code to scan the code generated by SSN merchants. 

**Aside from the Public Key from the Payment Address Resolver request, all other information regarding payment (transaction currency, transaction amount etc.) shall be read from the QR Code.**

## QR Code Payload

### Data Description

The content of the QR Code generated from SSN includes the following information:

### Data Organization

The Payload Format Indicator (ID "00") must be the first data object in the QR Code while the CRC (ID "63") must be the last data object in the QR Code. All other objects may be placed in any position.

The ID for the Merchant Account Information or any other ID other than the ID for the Globally Unique Identifier can be arbitrarily chosen.

### Constructing a Static QR Code

In this example, we are constructing a static QR code to request for a payment of 5.00 USD for a prepaid phone card payable to ABC Phone Shop. This static QR code can be scanned multiple times which is useful when the merchant needing to only have a single QR code for multiple transactions.

### Constructing a Dynamic QR Code

In this example below, we are constructing a Dynamic QR code for an invoice number 1925-001 payable to ABC Phone Shop merchant.

Tranasction amount is not present in this case meaning that the mobile app would prompt the customer to enter the transaction amount.
