Accounts security settings
==========================

This document refers to the configuration of Account which represent

* Merchants, 
* Service Providers or 
* Payment Providers

and it describes the setup of those account.

# Accounts

## Account Security

Stellar uses signatures for authorization. Transactions always need authorization from at least one public key in order to be considered valid. Generally, transactions only need authorization from the public key of the source account. 

Transaction signatures are created by cryptographically signing the transaction object contents with a secret key. SSN currently uses the ed25519 signature scheme, but thereâ€™s also a mechanism for adding additional types of public/private key schemes. A transaction with an attached signature is considered to have authorization from that public key.

Accounts are identified by a public key. The private key that corresponds to this public key is called the master key. When additional keys are added to the account, each key should be assigned a weight to identify which operations can be authorized by this key.

## Thresholds

Each operation which changes the state of the network falls under a specific threshold category: low, medium, or high. 

Each account can set its own threshold values. By default all thresholds levels are set to 0, and the master key is set to weight 1. The Set Options operation allows you to change the weight of the master key and to add other signing keys with different weights.

| Threshold | function
| --- | --- |
| low | able to modify trust lines
| medium | able to sign transactions
| high | able to change keys

The threshold for a given level can be set to any number from 0-255. This threshold is the amount of signature weight required to authorize an operation at that level.

**In order to submit a valid operation the combined weight of all keys which signed the transaction must be greater or equal then the threshold limit of the operation.**

Additional keys can be assigned to an account with different key weights to give permission to perform a given operation. Threshold weight and key weight can be setup in combination to require more then 1 key to sign the operation. 

We recommend to use different keys to ensure security of the account.

* **security keys** used for high threshold operations
* **transaction keys** used for signing transactions
* **trustline keys** for low threshold operations (optional)
* **api keys** used for encryption only
* **master keys** not used on the network (disabled)

## Recommended Account threshold settings

We recommend to configure an account with the following settings

* 3 high security keys, whereby 2 keys are required to execute high security functions, each key should be held by a different person in the organization
* 1 transaction signing key use for daily operation
* 1 API key, used for encryption only, no able to sign transaction
* 1 master key, disabled.

It is highly recommended for asset issuing account (e.g. Payment Providers) to have an asset issuing account, and a payment account. The payment account would be used in daily operations and is toped up from the asset issuing account to provide liquidity.

On SSN any asset issuing account must be configured to have at least 2 additional signing keys attached to the account, and the master key must be disabled (weight set to 0).
