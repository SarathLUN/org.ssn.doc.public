Configuration of Accounts on SSN
================================

This document refers to the configuration of Account which represent

* Merchants, 
* Service Providers or 
* Payment Providers

and it describes the setup of those account.

# Security Setup

Transactions on SSN are made by submitting signed transactions to the API endpoint, every account has a public key and a secret seed. The account itself is a public key, and the accounts secret seed could be used for signing transaction.

SSN support 3 levels of access security per account:

| Threshold | function
| --- | --- |
| low | able to modify trust lines
| medium | able to sign transactions
| high | able to change keys

Each of the thresholds can be assigned a weight as numeric value. Different keys can be assigned to an account with different key weights to give permission to perform a given operation. Function weight and key weight can be setup in combination to require more then 1 key to sign the operation.

We recommend to use different keys to ensure security of the account.

* **security keys** used for high threshold operations
* **transaction keys** used for signing transactions
* **api keys** used for encryption only
* **master keys** not used on the network (disabled)

On SSN any asset issuing account should be configured to have at least 2 additional signing key attached to the account, and the master key should be disabled (weight set to 0). 

Ideal The account should be configured 

* 3 high security keys, whereby 2 keys are required to execute high security functions
* 1 transaction signing key use for daily operation
* 1 API key, used for encryption only, no able to sign transaction
* 1 master key, disabled.

It is highly recommended for asset issuing account (e.g. Payment Providers) to have an asset issuing account, and a payment account. The payment account would be used in daily operations and is toped up from the asset issuing account to provide liquidity.

# KYC settings

## Payment Providers

Asset issuing account belonging to payment providers should have the following information set on their account using data fields.

| Field | Description
| --- | --- 
| home_domain | domain which links to the Cashier API (domain only) 
| net_payout | rate at which the token will be redeemed for the underlying asset e.g. 0.9950
