Payment addresses and payment address details
===========================================

# Payment addresses

Payment addresses on SSN are used to exchange information about payment details in a secure and federated environment. A payment address consists of 2 parts, a user defined string which contains details that are relevant to the issuer of the payment request, and a federated address in the form of a domain name, separated by a '*'.

```
payment_detail*company.example
```

Payment addresses can be resolved via lookup from the central payment address resolver implemented by SSN ```https://pa.ssn.digital``` or directly with the issuer of the payment request by resolving the domain and locating the relevant configuration entry. 

The domain must host a TOML file at a well known location which will point to the address of the resolver to use ```company.example/.well-known/ssn.toml.``` Within this file the payment request issuer must list a setting which points to the payment address resolver 

```ini
FEDERATION_SERVER="https://pa.ssn.digital/v1/"
```

If the domain does not contain a federation resolver configuration, the central SSN resolver should be queried. The API for the resolver is documented at [https://api-reference.ssn.digital](https://api-reference.ssn.digital/?urls.primaryName=SSN%20payment%20address%20resolver%20API)

# Payment details

When the payment address is resolved it will return a description of the payment request. The object is separated into an envelop which contains payment routing information and a detail record which contains payment details.
