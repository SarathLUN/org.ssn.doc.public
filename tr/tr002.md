Payment addresses and payment address details
===========================================

# Payment addresses

Payment addresses on SSN are used to exchange information about payment details in a secure and federated environment. A payment address consists of 2 parts, a user defined string which contains details that are relevant to the issuer of the payment request, and a federated address in the form of a domain name, separated by a `*`.

```
payment_detail*company.example
```

Payment addresses can be resolved via lookup from the central payment address resolver implemented by SSN ```https://pa.ssn.digital``` or directly with the issuer of the payment request by resolving the domain and locating the relevant configuration entry. 

The domain must host a TOML file at a well known location which will point to the address of the resolver to use ```company.example/.well-known/ssn.toml.``` Within this file the payment request issuer must list a setting which points to the payment address resolver 

```ini
FEDERATION_SERVER="https://pa.ssn.digital/v1/"
```

If the domain does not contain a federation resolver configuration, the central SSN resolver should be queried. The API for the resolver is documented at [https://api-reference.ssn.digital](https://api-reference.ssn.digital/?urls.primaryName=SSN%20payment%20address%20resolver%20API)

Since version 2, payment address resolver responses also support service discovery, see oracle responses below.

# Return values for a payment request

When the payment address is resolved it will return a description of the payment request. The object is separated into an envelop which contains payment routing information and a detail record which contains payment details.

The envelop will contain the following information:

## Envelop

| entry | type | presents | meaning
|---|---|---|---
| network_address | string | Mandatory | address on SSN to where the transaction will be made
| payment_type | string | Mandatory | type of response
| service_name | string | Mandatory | 'doing business as' name for the merchant that is recognizable to the consumer
| details | array | Mandatory | details of the payment information

*payment_type - type of response*

| value | meaning
| --- | ---
| merchant | merchant payment details
| bill | biller payment details, may request a service fee charge in addition to the payment
| oracle | response for service discovery

## details

The payment details will contain the following information

| entry | type | presents | meaning
|---|---|---|---
| payment_info | string | Optional | description of the payment
| memo | string | Mandatory | payment routing information for the merchant
| payment | array | Mandatory | Amounts and currency for the payment
| service_fee | array | Optional | Amounts and currency for the service fee 

## payment (and service_fee)

For ```payment``` and ```service_fee``` there can be more then one data block in the response, one for each currency the merchant will accept, with or without the amount to be paid.

| entry | type | presents | meaning
|---|---|---|---
| asset_code | string | Mandatory | currency (asset) to charge, the response should only contain asset codes for which the merchant has established trust lines with the payment service provider
| amount | money | Optional | amount to charge (if empty, customer needs to be asked)

It is possible to repeat this data block, giving a choice for multiple currencies; for example giving a price in KHR and USD. The response may also include payments in store credit assets if supported by the payment service provider and agreed with the merchant.

## Examples

Response for a top-up to a mysabay account, the user can top-up in USD or KHR but the user should be asked for the amount.

```json
{
  "network_address": "GBNV4PMFUTPYRKVQZV7V47W46KGZLKK5GWVAEXYPS7QJVQWY4B6X43JS",
  "payment_type": "merchant",
  "service_name": "mySabay User Top-up",
  "details": {
    "payment_info": "Top up for Dirk Gently",
    "memo": "37837941",
    "payment": [
      {
        "asset_code": "KHR"
      },
      {
        "asset_code": "USD"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Response for paying a invoice from e-CamShopping.com, the user can choose the pay the invoice either in USD or KHR.

```json
{

  "payment_type": "merchant",
  "service_name": "eCamShopping.com",
  "details": {
    "payment_info": "Payment for Invoice 124725",
    "memo": "inv124725",
    "payment": [
      {
        "asset_code": "KHR",
        "amount": 12500
      },
      {
        "asset_code": "USD",
        "amount" : 3.05
      }
    ]
  }
}
```


# Return values for service discovery requests

Oracle request or service discovery request will return a list of payment choices rather then multiple options for 1 payment. Oracle responses are used to query a service provider for a list of subscriptions options or packages on sale. 

A oracle response is meant to be presented to a user as a select option where only option can be chosen, the the payment address in corresponding package option is to be used to resolve the payment details. Payment address maybe stored by the payment service provider in order to initiate recurring payment plans.

Oracle responses are defined, but each service may have a different payment address format for requesting a oracle response. The recommended format is a request in the form of:

```
user_id:packages*service.company.example
```

This would let the service know that the payment service provider wants to discover services (packages) available for the user id in the request when using a payment service provider. Services and pricing may differ for each payment service providers.

In a oracle response the following fields have different meaning:

| entry | type | presents | change
|---|---|---|---
| payment_type | string | Mandatory | must be `oracle`
| memo | string | Optional | empty for oracle responses

The oracle response extends the payment array with the following data entries and changes the present requirements for amount 

| entry | type | presents | meaning
|---|---|---|---
| asset_code | string | Mandatory | currency (asset) in which to charge
| amount | money | Mandatory | amount to charge
| package | string | Mandatory | description of the package
| payment_address | string | Mandatory | when the user selects the package, the payment details must be required using this exact payment address
| is_recurring | enum | Optional | this payment address can be used as recurring payment (true, false)
| recurring_duration | string | Conditional | if the payment can be recurring, how long until the next payment should be made to keep the subscription active

recurring_duration - is a string containing the duration and the date-part, valid date parts are - day, month, year. Example 7 day, 1 month, 3 month, 1 year, with no plurals.
